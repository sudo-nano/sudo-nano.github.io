This is a reference sheet (and testing zone) for all my custom CSS. Nice work
finding it, since it's not indexed! 

## Custom `abbr` pop up 

<abbr title="Problem Exists Between Chair and Keyboard">PEBCAK</abbr>

## Lancer Horus Text Distortion
> The Horus distortion text is flashy and eye-strainy, so I won't use it outside
> the testing page until I write an opt-in dialogue for the effects.
{: .prompt-warning}
<p class="horus--subtle">subtle distortion</p>

> Extreme eye strain warning for mousing over the below text!
{: .prompt-warning}
<code class="horus">EXTREME DISTORTION</code>
