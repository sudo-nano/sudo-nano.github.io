My partner and I have been considering purchasing an espresso machine for some
time. We both love coffee, and find its production fascinating. (See my 
[post on making Vietnamese coffee](https://sudo-nano.github.io/posts/Vietnamese-Coffee/))
The main thing stopping us was the cost. We're college students with an
appreciation for quality, which is a perilous place for our wallets. Espresso
is a prominent part of the coffee world, despite being one of the least
accessible parts of it. When we
saw an espresso machine available at a price-negotiable thrift store, we both
knew we had to have it. Since neither he or the store knew whether it worked, 
he secured it for only $2. 

## Hardware
The espresso machine is a DeLonghi ECP3120. It's a single boiler machine that 
comes with three baskets: a single shot basket, double shot basket, and single 
shot pod basket for use with Easy Serve Espresso pods. All three are 
pressurized baskets. The machine has internal
storage for the extra baskets, which the previous owner clearly did not use. 
The only basket that came with our used machine was the pod basket. 
Against better judgement, I attempted to pull
some single shots with this basket, but all of them turned out undrinkably
acidic. 

Having failed to make use of the stock portafilter and basket, I set out to
find an aftermarket one. This machine uses a 51mm portafilter, which is 
nonstandard. Nobody except DeLonghi uses this size. Most other machines use 54mm.
The only search results were
[a few](https://www.amazon.com/portafilter-Delonghi-bottomless-Stainless-Replacement/dp/B09W5QY63R)
[bottomless](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-naked-bottomless-portafilter)
[portafilter baskets.](https://ikapestore.com/products/ikape-coffee-products-51mm-bottomless-naked-portafilter-compatible-with-51mm-delonghi-ec0680-ec0685-smeg-eupa-coffee-machines-included-14g-capacity-filter-basket)

As I noticed similarity between many of the search results, a sneaking 
suspicion crept up on me. A quick search revealed that indeed, nearly all of
them are 
[resold from Aliexpress.](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-51mm-portafilter-2-ear.html?g=y&SearchText=51mm+portafilter+2+ear) 
To their credit, [Normcore's 51mm portafilter and basket](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-naked-bottomless-portafilter) 
was the only one made in-house. Unfortunately, I only
realized while writing up this blog post, by which point I had already cut out
the middleman and purchased a portafilter directly from Aliexpress. While I 
truly appreciate Normcore's ray of hope amidst the slave labor mass production
garbage, there are still no precision baskets or standalone baskets available
for 51mm portafilters. The only 
3rd party baskets available are the stock ones that come with these portafilters.

## Making Espresso
In the production of our espresso, we used a Baratza Encore 485 grinder, a
star anise bottle as an improvised tamper, and an Aliexpress bottomless 
portafilter with its included double shot basket. Not exactly a professional
setup, but adequate for our purposes.

We dialed in three coffees, two from local roasters and one from Trader Joe's.
- *Lotus* from Ca Phe: medium-light roast
- *Holy Roller* from Heretic Coffee: medium-light roast, complex, grain notes 
- Trader Joe's Fair Trade Ethiopian: medium-dark roast

Ca Phe *Lotus*, while fantastic as a pour over, was undrinkably sour no 
matter what we tried. Doses as high as we could cram in the basket, grinds as
fine as the grinder went, pull times as long as 30 seconds. I suspect the 
pressure or temperature of this machine is not enough to get good extraction on lighter and more acidic coffees. 
Unfortunately, we lack the facilities to properly test this hypothesis.[1]

Heretic Coffee's *Holy Roller* provides a nice complex and grain-forward flavor. 
The Heretic owner explained to us that they had designed the roast to make good
lattes, and it sure did. After the complete failure pulling the *Lotus*, we
were pleasantly surprised by how well it worked given the lightness of the
roast. This one will remain a household favorite for lattes, 
and we made many fantastic pumpkin spice lattes using 
[Morgan Eckroth's 2024 pumkpin spice latte recipe](https://morgandrinkscoffee.com/blogs/recipes-1/how-to-make-a-pumpkin-spice-latte).

Trader Joe's Ethiopian makes a solid cappucino. 
There's not as much aromatic complexity as the other coffees,
but the unique flavor of the Ethiopian coffee still comes through.
Our housemates (laypeople, not coffee hobbyists) rated it as a solid 
latte. Despite the darker roast, there was very little bitterness. 
Compared to the lighter roasts, espresso made with this coffee was the most
similar to its pour over counterpart. 
This is neither a positive or a negative. 

## Steaming Milk
The milk steaming performance of this machine is just ok.
It comes with a
panarello steam wand, a typical feature of entry-level machines. This style of
steam wand makes it easy to incorporate air into your milk. In my opinion, it
makes it too easy, and it's basically impossible to *stop* adding air. 
That makes it easy to reach the desired volume, but very difficult to refine
your milk into the microfoam texture that you want for latte art. 
The panarello tip comes off easily for cleaning, held on by a twist-lock. 
Normally I'd recommend steaming milk without the panarello tip, but
underneath is a friction-fit rubber tip that's easily blown off by the 
steam. The steaming quality is adequate for entry level, but not suitable for latte art.
Those pickier about their milk texture may wish to use a microwave and
a frothing wand, or pick another machine.

## Conclusion
This machine is a good starting point for entry level coffee enjoyers.
It comes with a lot of training wheels, mainly the pressurized baskets and the
panarello tip steam wand. 
At the MSRP of $150, we struggle to recommend it for intermediate coffee enjoyers, especially
because of the lack of third party upgrades. 
If you can acquire one used, it's a great educational experience. 
It makes decent espresso from medium and darker roasts, but starkly illustrates
the increased precision and machine quality necessary for pulling lighter roast
specialty coffees and perfecting your milk texture. 


## Footnotes
[^1]: Though portafilters with pressure gauges exist, this machine is a nonstandard basket size. It would require machining a custom portafilter for use with a pressure gauge. We would be interested in undertaking this project had we the time or funds.
