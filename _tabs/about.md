## Culinary Projects:
Making drinks (coffee and tea) makes me happy. Making them for other people,
and getting it down to a science, makes me happier. See the 
[coffee tag]({{ site.url }}/tags/coffee/) for my coffee science. 
(At present, no posts have been published under tea or alcohol.)

- How to make killer chai (work in progress)
- How to make pho (far future)


# FAQs
## Why is this blog called Flash of Stupid? 

In Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition (the most recent at the time of writing), the Artificer class has an ability called Flash of Genius. 

> Starting at 7th level, you gain the ability to come up with solutions under pressure. When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you makes an ability check or a saving throw, you can use your reaction to add your Intelligence modifier to the roll.
> 
> You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

Notably, this ability doesn't specify that the modifier must be positive, or that the creature must be willing. If you get another spellcaster to cast **feeblemind** on your artificer, their intelligence is reduced to 1, and their intelligence modifier to -5. This allows the artificer to subtract 5 from an ability check or saving throw of anyone they can see that's within 30 feet, even an enemy. 

As with flash of genius, sometimes you have to come up with solutions under pressure. Sometimes those solutions are terrible, but hilarious, like the above strategy. Hence, flash of stupid. 

## What is physical penetration testing?
**Penetration testing** is when you test your security measures by attempting
to break them. Digital penetration testing involves trying to hack into computer
systems to test their security. However, no firewall will save you if someone can
just pick up your server and walk away with it. That's why we have physical security.
Physical penetration testing is where you physically attempt to break in, usually 
to lay hands on servers or get access to other sensitive infrastructure. 

Pretty cool, right? That's why I want it to be my job.
