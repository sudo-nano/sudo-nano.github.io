Hi! I'm TheMagicalC, you can find me on most platforms as that or cwg1231.
On GitHub, I'm sudo-nano. I'm an undergraduate computer science 
student and nuclear reactor operator.

I like amateur radio, physical and digital security and penetration testing, 
video games, intellectual property and civil rights law, programming,
wireless hacking, and counter-surveillance/privacy.
Ask me about accessibility and disability accommodations in education!

Proudly queer. Trans rights are human rights.
