title: Experiments and Explorations with TheMagicalC
layout: home
---

Hey, thanks for visiting! You may know me as TheMagicalC or cwg1231 on most platforms, or sudo-nano on GitHub. This is where I organize my thoughts, explorations and experiments, in the hope that it will improve the internet just a little bit. 

This blog is a work in progress. I suppose most are, but I haven't finished designing the vibe for this one. 
The name is subject to change, and there will eventually be index pages for each tag. Feedback and suggestions are welcome.
