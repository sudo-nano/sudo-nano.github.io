In DnD 5e, Artificer has one of the loosest job descriptions of any class. Depending on both your playstyle and your DM's, this can lend incredible flexibility or cause a decent amount of strife. To ensure things go as smoothly as they can, there are a few things you should keep in mind. 

## How experienced is your DM?


## What's your DM's style?

You need to know how your DM likes to build encounters, and what kind they like to build. Do they favor combat or roleplay? Open-world exploration, or dungeon crawls? How much will they railroad the party into the plot? These are all extremely important, because they determine how your DM will expect you to work with them.
