Working with the Deep Rock Galactic mining company is relatively safe. [Citation Needed] Here's a list of the times it wasn't. 

1. **Karl's Demise** - [INFORMATION REDACTED]

2. **The Adeptus Custodes Incident** - One salvage team was so intent on learning about the Adeptus Custodes that they forgot about the extraction timer. 

3. **Sandblasted Hell Extraction** - Mission Control made a teeny weeny, itsy bitsy, 35% accuracy error when placing the drop pod. Long story short, it ended up perched on a sky-high ledge, and the team was forced to climb from the depths of the sandblasted corridors to make it to LZ. They made a heroic effort, but were unsuccessful.
