## The 95 Theses of Why Computers were a Mistake

1. Sand was not meant to think. We think ourselves to be like Prometheus, having stolen the secrets of putting lightning in rocks from the gods, but look at where it's gotten us. 

2. I hate printers

3. I fucking hate smart TVs. Godddamn motherfucking smart TVs. If I wanted to deal with computer problems, I'd get on the computer. I don't want computer problems in my TV.
