When it comes to coping with ADHD, there's a
prevailing sentiment that all your problems can be solved if you just pick a
coping mechanism and stick to it. If it's not working for you, you just need
to pick a different mechanism and put all of your effort into it. While I 
can't definitively say that this doesn't work for anyone, most people I know
have gone round and round trying planners and calendars and productivity apps
and just about everything else that anyone has ever recommended to them.

Examples to use:
- Switching between digital and paper notes
