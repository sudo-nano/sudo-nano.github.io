This post is targeted towards a general audience. No prior knowledge is required. 


Cyberpunk, in this context, refers to a setting in which there's high tech (that's the cyber) and the tech is used as a means of exerting power over disadvantaged people. Technology is an indiscriminate force multiplier. Corporations, unchained from regulations by either their absence or their lack of enforcement, fully utilize this to expand their influence, often weakening or supplanting local governments. This weakening of local governments is not a new idea. It's been done by economic means since there's been accumulation of wealth, and industrialization only made it easier. The thing that makes it cyberpunk is the further acceleration of this practice by computers.

The indiscriminate nature of technology also lends it to being the tool of the people. The only computer we know how to make is what we call a Turing machine, a computer that can run any program. Software and hardware can be designed to make it arbitrarily difficult to run some types of programs, but you can't make it impossible for a computer to run certain types of programs under any circumstances. This means that no matter how hard corporate engineers try to make it so that you can only use their proprietary software, or their compatible proprietary hardware, technology is always hackable. 

Hacking in this case is not just the act of compromising someone else's computer. In the context of this article series, and most often as used by hackers, means modifying technology to function in a way not intended by its creators.
