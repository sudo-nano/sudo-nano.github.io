<!-- TODO: Insert explanation of what a onewheel is -->

I've had a Onewheel Pint for a long time. In 5 years, I've put 1100 miles on
it. While less practical than a bike (electrically assisted or otherwise), 
it's a uniquely fun mode of transport. The last 3 years, I've used it to get
around the area of my college campus. After all this time, I have a few things
to say about the experience. 

## It's really fun
As a lifelong surfer, learning to ride a onewheel[^1] was natural. I was always 
hesitant to learn how to skate. The prospect of eating concrete as soon as I 
hit a pebble was not attractive. The large tire and electric power of a 
onewheel makes it viable for trips you would normally undertake on a bicycle or 
personal electric vehicle (PEV).[^2] I've been riding a bike my whole life, 
but a onewheel adds some spice to short routine trips in a way that bikes 
don't.

## Opinions on last mile transportation
One of the reasons I brought my onewheel to college is that my
area has a lot of public transit, and I envisioned using it for last-mile 
transportation. Having spent 3 years traversing this new-to-me city, my
takeaway is that using PEVs for last-mile transportation is mostly a fantasy 
dreamed up by transportation company shareholders. 

The primary reason for this is quite simple: walking is nice and costs less. 
I attend college in the Pacific Northwest, so there's hospitable weather most 
of the year. It's not like Las Vegas, where I regret every second I spend outside an air
conditioned building. When the weather is worse, and it's raining intensely, 
a onewheel and its stock racing slick struggle to retain traction.[^3]

## Future Motion is an awful company

Unfortunately, the experience as a customer of Future Motion (the company that sells name brand Onewheels)
has been nothing short of awful.

Outline:
1. What is a onewheel and why do I like them?
2. Detail Future Motion's ongoing anti-consumer shenanigans (long section)
  a. Inherently anti-consumer design such as non-standard tire size
  b. Parts pairing
  c. Further firmware shenanigans + DMCA takedowns
  Note: Try to do some investigation into what happened to JW batteries and the JWFFM chip
3. Describe how the shenanigans have materially impacted me
4. Tangent: Oregon right to repair law
5. Conclusion: I'll just buy a floatwheel

## Footnotes 
[^1]: The lack of capitalization here is intentional. In writing this post, 
I've made the stylistic choice that "onewheel" will be capitalized when 
referring to specific Future Motion products, like the Onewheel Pint, 
but otherwise lowercase to refer to the general class of single wheel electric
skateboards.

[^2]: A personal electric vehicle (PEV) is a small electric vehicle that
typically transports a single person, occasionally two. 

[^3]: In the last 100 miles, I've been using a lightly treaded [Float Life Enduro tire](https://thefloatlife.com/collections/pint-accessories/products/tfl-enduro-tire-pint-pint-x-compatible), 
which has been fantastic. It works much better in the rain.
