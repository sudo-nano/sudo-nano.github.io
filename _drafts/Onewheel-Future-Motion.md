<!-- TODO: Insert explanation of what a onewheel is -->

I've had a Onewheel Pint for a long time. In 5 years, I've put 1100 miles on
it. While less practical than a bike (electrically assisted or otherwise), 
it's a uniquely fun mode of transport. The last 3 years, I've used it to get
around the area of my college campus. After all this time, I have a few things
to say about the experience. 

## It's really fun
As a lifelong surfer, learning to ride a onewheel[^1] was natural. I was always 
hesitant to learn how to skate. The prospect of eating concrete as soon as I 
hit a pebble was not attractive. The large tire and electric power of a 
onewheel makes it viable for trips you would normally undertake on a bicycle or 
personal electric vehicle (PEV).[^2] I've been riding a bike my whole life, 
but a onewheel adds some spice to short routine trips in a way that bikes 
don't.

## Opinions on last mile transportation
One of the reasons I brought my onewheel to college is that my
area has a lot of public transit, and I envisioned using it for last-mile 
transportation. Having spent 3 years traversing this new-to-me city, my
takeaway is that using PEVs for last-mile transportation is mostly a fantasy 
dreamed up by transportation company shareholders. 

The primary reason for this is quite simple: walking is nice and costs less. 
I attend college in the Pacific Northwest, so there's hospitable weather most 
of the year. It's not like Las Vegas, where I regret every second I spend 
outside an air
conditioned building. When the weather is worse, and it's raining intensely, 
a onewheel and its stock racing slick struggle to retain traction.[^3] Walking
outside is nice, and having to stash my onewheel somewhere when I arrive at the
destination is enough of a minor annoyance that I just won't bother most of the
time. 

Of course, you can't forget about your friends either. If you're going 
somewhere with your friends, you'll be walking with them unless all of them
also have a vehicle of some sort. Bike rides with friends are a treasure, but
are not as common as I'd like them to be. 

Finally, owning a PEV in the US may require financial privilege. The US is
extremely car centric. If you're somewhere without reliable public transit, 
a car might be necessary to commute to work and go shopping anywhere farther
than you want to walk. Though battery prices have dropped precipitously
within our lifetimes, PEVs are still a substantial purchase, and are not 
always viable as primary transportation. This relegates them to being pleasure
craft anywhere outside a large city. 

## Future Motion is an awful company

Unfortunately, the experience of patronizing Future Motion (the company that 
sells name brand Onewheels) has been nothing short of awful. They're extremely
anti-right to repair, and employ patents and technology to stop you from
repairing your own Onewheel.

First, their Onewheels are intentionally designed to impede third party repair
and servicing. The XR and GT models use 6.5" tires, breaking compatibility with
existing 6" tires. The chargers use XLR or mini XLR connectors for power, 
preventing use of a standard DC power supply with a barrel jack. They even
engage in **parts pairing**, the practice of digitially pairing each component
to the main board bricking the board if a user swaps the parts on their own. 
Not only does this block third party parts, but it even blocks OEM parts from
other Onewheels that are the same model. This is, of course, so that you they
can extort customers by charging exorbitant repair fees, since they're the only
game in town.

Second, Future Motion uses litigation to squash anyone attempting to make
interoperable parts. JW Batteries made a chip called the JWFFM (short for JW 
Fuck Future Motion) that was able to defeat pairing between the battery 
management system and the main board, allowing users to install aftermarket
batteries. Future Motion sued them, alleging infringement of the Digital 
Millenium Copyright Act and the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.[^4]



## Footnotes 
[^1]: The lack of capitalization here is intentional. In writing this post, 
I've made the stylistic choice that "onewheel" will be capitalized when 
referring to specific Future Motion products, like the Onewheel Pint, 
but otherwise lowercase to refer to the general class of single wheel electric
skateboards.

[^2]: A personal electric vehicle (PEV) is a small electric vehicle that
typically transports a single person, occasionally two. 

[^3]: In the last 100 miles, I've been using a lightly treaded [Float Life Enduro tire](https://thefloatlife.com/collections/pint-accessories/products/tfl-enduro-tire-pint-pint-x-compatible), 
which has been fantastic. It works much better in the rain.
