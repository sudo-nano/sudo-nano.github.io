<!-- TODO: Insert explanation of what a onewheel is -->

I've been a long time owner of a Onewheel Pint. As a mode of transportation, it's been pretty great. 
As a lifelong surfer, learning to ride a onewheel was natural. I was always hesitant to learn how to skate, 
because the prospect of eating concrete as soon as I hit a pebble was not attractive. The larger tire 
and electric power of a onewheel makes it a much more viable mode of transportation for the kind of 
trips you would normally undertake on a bicycle or similar small personal vehicle. 

Unfortunately, the experience as a customer of Future Motion (the company that sells name brand Onewheels)
has been nothing short of awful. 

Outline: 
1. What is a onewheel and why do I like them?
2. Detail Future Motion's ongoing anti-consumer shenanigans (long section)
  a. Inherently anti-consumer design such as non-standard tire size 
  b. Parts pairing 
  c. Further firmware shenanigans + DMCA takedowns 
  Note: Try to do some investigation into what happened to JW batteries and the JWFFM chip 
3. Describe how the shenanigans have materially impacted me 
4. Tangent: Oregon right to repair law 
5. Conclusion: I'll just buy a floatwheel
