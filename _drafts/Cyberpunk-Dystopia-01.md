## Introduction

This is the second post in a series about what we can do to make real life less 
of a cyberpunk dystopia. The first post is 
[here.](https://sudo-nano.github.io/posts/Cyberpunk-Dystopia-00/) 
This post is targeted towards a general audience. No prior knowledge is required. 
If something is unclear, please refer to the footnotes or [contact me to ask for 
clarification.](https://sudo-nano.github.io/about/)

Portable electronics, because of their newness, exist in a sort of cultural limbo: 
They are completely pervasive in everyday life, yet we have little to no generational 
knowledge about their care and maintenance. 
This is in part because they've only existed for about one generation, but in equal 
part by the intention of manufacturers through planned obsolescence.[^1] 
In contrast to something like cars, where maintenance practices are well-known and 
parts are intended to be replaced by a user or mechanic, many portable electronics 
are designed so that the battery is unserviceable. 
Most often seen in phones, e-readers, wireless headphones, and thin laptops, it's 
usually the case that either the device is not meant to be opened for any maintenance 
at all, or the battery is not installed in such a way that it can be removed safely. 

This is usually done in service of the aforementioned planned obsolescence, so that 
manufacturers can force consumers to buy a new device at the cost of increased electronic 
waste (sometimes abbreviated e-waste). Besides the obvious detriment of manufacturers 
wringing more money out of consumers for shorter device lifetimes, e-waste is more 
harmful to people and the environment than traditional garbage.

[^1]: **Planned obsolescence** (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain pre-determined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable.
