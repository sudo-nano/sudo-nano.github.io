This is the second post in a series about what we can do to make real life less of a cyberpunk dystopia. The first post is here (INSERT LINK WHEN FIRST POST IS PUBLISHED) This post is targeted towards a general audience. No prior knowledge is required. 

<!--The development of battery technology has allowed portable electronics to become ubiquitous in everyday life. -->

Portable electronics, because of their newness, exist in a sort of cultural limbo: They are completely pervasive in everyday life, yet we have little to no generational knowledge about their care and maintenance. This is in part because they've only existed for about one generation, but in equal part by the intention of manufacturers through planned obsolescence.[^1] In contrast to something like cars, where maintenance practices are well-known and parts are intended to be replaced by a user or mechanic, many portable electronics are designed so that the battery is unserviceable. Most often seen in phones, e-readers, headphones, and thin laptops, it's usually the case that either the device is not meant to be opened for any maintenance at all, or the battery is not installed in such a way that it can be removed safely. 


[^1]: **Planned obsolescence** (also called built-in obsolescence or premature obsolescence) is a policy of planning or designing a product with an artificially limited useful life or a purposely frail design, so that it becomes obsolete after a certain pre-determined period of time upon which it decrementally functions or suddenly ceases to function, or might be perceived as unfashionable.
