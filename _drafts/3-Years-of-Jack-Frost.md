## Introduction
For the past three years, I've cosplayed as Jack Frost from Rise of the Guardians
at Halloween, Rose City Comic Con, and Emerald City Comic Con. 
I've made 1 hoodie and 3 staffs. Some of the staffs didn't even get completed
before they were destroyed. Even still, I hope this account inspires some people
to get started with cosplay. It can be intimidating, since a lot of people are so
incredibly put together, but you can have a lot of fun without a ton of investment
or experience.

## The First Staff
The first staff was made of Ace Hardware's cheapest rod stock, with a single
decking screw holding each section onto the next. If that sounds like they
might rotate in place instead of holding firm, you're right. It was pretty
poorly secured, but the mating surfaces of each rod were lovingly carved 
into curves to make them fit together nicely. I only drew blood with the
dremel once. Unfortunately, that staff was not long for this world.
Before I could even texture it, I broke it while stage fighting 
with a friend. 

## The Second Staff
After rebuilding the second frame in the same wobbly glory as the first,
it was time for texturing. I made the extremely questionable choice of
using polymer clay, because I had no clue what I was doing. This was the second
cosplay prop I'd ever made, so texturing was a new skill for me. 
Since I wanted a stylized wood texture, my plan was to roll the clay into
thin ropes and wrap them around the staff. 
Just after receiving my clay, but before starting the texturing process, I 
decided to make even thinner ropes and twist them together for a more
intricate texture. This looked great, but I failed to account for how labor
intensive it was. Final texturing went late into the night on the day before
Rose City Comic Con 2024.
Polymer clay is normally baked in the oven, but this stick was way too big for that.
Instead, I used a heat gun to heat up the clay in sections until it baked.
