This is the 
NTH <!-- Edit this AND THE TITLE before posting -->
post in a series about what we can do to make real life less 
of a cyberpunk dystopia. The first post is 
[here.](https://sudo-nano.github.io/posts/Cyberpunk-Dystopia-00/) 
This post is targeted towards a general audience. No prior knowledge is required. 
If something is unclear, please refer to the footnotes or [contact me to ask for 
clarification.](https://sudo-nano.github.io/about/)

## Introduction
**Open source** is the idea of an object's design plans or software's source code
being publicly available. While there are many ideological reasons[^1] for supporting
open source hardware and software, this post will primarily cover the practical 
reasons. While open source most often refers to software, we will discuss both hardware
and software. 

"Critical systems" here means any systems whose failure are more likely than not 
to cause serious injury (physical or otherwise) and/or loss of life. This definition
encompasses systems that would cause direct harm, such as the failure of a medical 
device or autonomous vehicles that would kill a person. It also encompasses systems that 
would cause indirect harm, such as the failure of a banking system preventing people 
from accessing money needed to purchase necessities, or supply chain failures 
preventing delivery of those necessities. 

## Why Open Source? 

Closed source, or proprietary devices, have several problems.
1. They're nearly impossible to maintain if abandoned by the original developers
2. Security research is severely hampered
3. Accountability auditing, i.e. checking that the devices work how the manufacturer
says they do, is much harder. 

### Eliminating Abandonware 
**Abandonware** is hardware or software that is no longer being supported by the 
manufacturer. For example, Windows XP's extended support by Microsoft was ended 
on April 8, 2014. It no longer receives updates, with only a few rare exceptions 
to patch serious security vulnerabilities. Because Windows XP is no longer supported, 
there are tons of unpatched vulnerabilities that would allow someone to easily gain 
control of your computer.
