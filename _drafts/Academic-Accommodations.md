This post is intended for all audiences, but primarily covers the American
education system and the rights of students in the United States. While I try to
avoid legal jargon in all-audiences posts, a certain amount is unavoidable when
discussing civil rights. To balance approachability and thoroughness, legal
citations will be footnotes rather than in-text citations.

Outline: 
- What are your rights? 
- How to apply for accommodations at your academic institution 
- What to do if teachers refuse to provide your accommodations 
- Handling accessibility issues not strictly covered by accommodations 
- The Nuclear Option: Filing a complaint with the Department of Education

Things to keep in mind: 
- At every step, outline options to do with and without a support system. 
  - With and without a lawyer 

## Why you need to know your rights
First and foremost, it's extremely important that you know your rights. Other
people will not exercise them for you. Public knowledge on this topic is 
downright abysmal, even in places like educational institutions where it's 
literally their job to know this. Worse, sometimes people will try to dissuade 
you from exercising your rights, simply because it's more convenient or 
profitable for them. 

## What are your rights? 
<!--
Relevant Legislation: 
- Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973
- Americans with Disabilities Act

## How to apply for accommodations at your school



## What to do if teachers refuse to provide your accommodations
If you have a documented disability, and your school's accessibility department 
approves your accommodations, it's illegal for a teacher to refuse to provide
your accommodations. They may not refuse them in whole or even in part.
Unfortunately, many teachers are poorly informed on the matter. Many are not
adequately informed by their workplace on what they can and cannot do. Even
those that are informed are often not instructed on how to best meet a 
student's needs. Most are only told how to reach bare minimum compliance under 
the law.
