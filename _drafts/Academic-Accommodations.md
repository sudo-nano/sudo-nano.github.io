## What are your rights? 

## How to apply for accommodations at your school



## What to do if teachers refuse to provide your accommodations
If you have a documented disability, and your school's accessibility department 
approves your accommodations, it's illegal for a teacher to refuse to provide
your accommodations. They may not refuse them in whole or even in part.
Unfortunately, many teachers are poorly informed on the matter. Many are not
adequately informed by their workplace on what they can and cannot do. Even
those that are informed are often not instructed on how to best meet a 
student's learning needs, only how to reach bare minimum compliance under the
law.
