This post is intended for all audiences, but primarily covers the American
education system and the rights of students in the United States. While I try to
avoid legal jargon in all-audiences posts, a certain amount is unavoidable when
discussing civil rights. To balance approachability and thoroughness, legal
citations will be footnotes rather than in-text citations.

Outline: 
- What are your rights? 
- How to apply for accommodations at your academic institution 
- What to do if teachers refuse to provide your accommodations 
- Handling accessibility issues not strictly covered by accommodations 
- The Nuclear Option: Filing a complaint with the Department of Education

Things to keep in mind: 
- At every step, outline options to do with and without a support system. 
  - With and without a lawyer 

## Know your rights
First and foremost, it's extremely important that you know your rights. Other
people will not exercise them for you. Public knowledge on this topic is 
downright abysmal, even in places like educational institutions where it's 
literally their job to know this. Worse, sometimes people will try to dissuade 
you from exercising your rights, simply because it's more convenient or 
profitable for them.

## How to apply for accommodations at your school
Every school has at least one person responsible for approving and coordinating
accommodations. The process usually involves submitting documentation for a disability, 
and then having an intake meeting where you discuss your needs. After the meeting, 
they decide which accommodations to grant you. This decision is usually made by one
person, and the reasonability of the decision varies widely. I had no trouble acquiring
my own accommodations at all schools except one, and we'll get to that later. If the
accommodations you've been granted are not to your liking, every school is required to
have some kind of appeals process. If you go through the appeals process and the outcome
is *still* not satisfactory, as sometimes happens, your only remedy may be a complaint to
the Department of Education Office of Civil Rights (DoE OCR). 

### Primary Education
If you're in primary education, that is, elementary, middle, or high school, you are
eligible to have a 504 plan or an Individualized Education Plan (IEP). A 504 plan is
the more moderate of these options, and more closely reflects the kind of accommodations
you see in secondary or postsecondary education. 


## What to do if teachers refuse to provide your accommodations
If you have a documented disability, and your school's accessibility department 
approves your accommodations, it's illegal for a teacher to refuse to provide
your accommodations. They may not refuse them in whole or even in part.
Unfortunately, many teachers are poorly informed on the matter. Many are not
adequately informed by their workplace on what they can and cannot do. Even
those that are informed are often not instructed on how to best meet a 
student's needs. Most are only told how to reach bare minimum compliance under 
the law.
