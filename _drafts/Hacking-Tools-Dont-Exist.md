Outline: 
- There's no such thing as hacking tools, only research, developer, and
diagnostic tools. 
- Technology is inherently neutral
- A tool becomes a "hacking tool" when it does something politically unfavorable
- Anyone calling for the banning of a "hacking tool" is clueless 
- Actual enforcement of hacking tool bans only exists to make examples out of
public figures 
- Banning "hacking tools" is a clear step into anti-intellectualism
