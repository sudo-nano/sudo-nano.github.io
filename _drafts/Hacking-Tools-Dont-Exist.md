## Outline (delete this later)
- There's no such thing as hacking tools, only tools useful for hacking.
- Any tool useful for hacking is also useful for research, development, and
diagnostics, therefore banning one is always a net negative.
- Technology is inherently neutral
- A tool becomes a "hacking tool" when it does something politically unfavorable
- Anyone calling for the banning of a "hacking tool" is clueless 
- Actual enforcement of hacking tool bans only exists to make examples out of
public figures 
- Banning "hacking tools" is a clear step into anti-intellectualism
- Mention flipper zero fearmongering

## Introduction
In an age where the pervasiveness of computers is rapidly outpacing tech 
literacy, it's quite easy to feel like computers are magic.
