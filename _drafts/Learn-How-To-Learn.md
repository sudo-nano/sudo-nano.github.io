If you're someone that learns a lot of things, at some point you may have 
wondered how to learn faster and better. (We'll talk about what "better" means
in a bit.) These are my collected thoughts from introspecting on my own learning
process over my 20 years of life so far. 

## What is learning? 
Learning can be described as a 4 step process:
1. Ingest information
2. Understand and contextualize
3. Build mechanical or informational skill
<!-- Informational skill example: Quickly recognizing chords or cadences without having to count half-steps -->
4. Retain information, context, and skills

As an example, you'll learn about a rudimentary piece of percussion instrument 
technique known as a paradiddle. 

### Ingest Information
Ingesting information is effectively reading a fact. Our example here: 
> A **paradiddle** is a sequence of four notes with a sticking pattern RLRR or LRLL. 

This is likely the first time this information has reached your brain, 
which is expected. It may have little context for you. That's also expected. 
You might know what
percussion is, but you probably don't know what sticking is, or what a pattern 
like "RLRR" means. 

While ingesting information, take note of unfamiliar terms. It will help with
revisiting them in the next step. The unfamiliar terms introduced in this 
section are: 
- paradiddle
- sticking pattern 

### Understand and Contextualize 
To transform words into understanding, we must unpack the definitions involved 
and learn the context in which these concepts exist. 

In the above definition for **paradiddle**, we mention **sticking patterns** and
give some examples.

> **Sticking Pattern:** Annotations that show which hand should be used to play
each note.
{: .prompt-info }

Sticking patterns are typically used for percussion instruments
that are played with two sticks, like drums. They are formatted as
strings of "L"s and "R"s to indicate playing a note with your left or right hand
respectively. A pattern of "RLRR" indicates that the first note should be played
with your right hand, the second note with your left, and the third and fourth
with your right.

_Example of sticking notation_

Sticking notation is only necessary for percussion, as other instruments either 
engage both hands in playing a note, or denote it in other ways. Valved 
instruments engage both hands, while keyboard instruments use separate staffs
(sets of note lines) for each hand. While in many cases sticking doesn't
matter (and is usually not written in those cases), sometimes composers assign
a recommended sticking or note the sticking that they found most comfortable for
complex sequences. 

With this context, you know what sticking patterns are for, or when you would
or wouldn't use them. 

### Build Mechanical or Informational Skill
At this point, you can play a paradiddle. A simple LRLL or RLRR is well within
your grasp. However, integrating a paradiddle into a piece of music requires
more flexibility. To do that, you'll need to practice a few skills: 

- Play a paradiddle in time with a metronome
- Play multiple paradiddles one after another, both alternating (RLRR LRLL) and
not (RLRR RLRR)[^1]
- Keep both hands playing notes at the same volume during your paradiddle
- Play a paradiddle at a faster tempo 

While these sound relatively simple, if you haven't done them before, they are
quite challenging. These are basic skills, but don't mistake basic for easy. 
Basic means they are foundational. Everything else relies on them. It's 
important that your basics are solid. Contrary to most people's expectations, 
this makes them the hardest part of the learning process. 

At this point, your mechanical skill must advance before you can master more
advanced techniques. Playing paradiddles at faster tempos requires strengthening
your hands through regular practice. Eventually, the tempo is too fast for 
you to articulate each individual stroke, so you have to learn how to play a 
diddle. 

> **Diddle:**
> The technique of playing more than one note per downwards hand movement,
> usually done by bouncing the stick between your hand and the drum head.[^2]

You *can* always attempt more advanced techniques before
solidifying your basics, but your learning will suffer for it. That's not to say
it's always a bad idea: If you remain unconvinced that practicing basics is
necessary, or have a hard time motivating yourself to practice them,
as I do, attempting to learn something more advanced will often produce an 
intuitive understanding of which basics require further practice. 
<!-- Talk more about percussion mechanical skills, "chops", playing faster -->

Not all types of learning require advancement of mechanical skill. 

### Retain information, context, and skills. 
<!-- Mention spaced repetition -->

## Set Realistic Goals
<!-- Set goals that give you a little headroom even if there are mistakes. -->

## Practice With Intention
<!-- Have a target skill to improve when practicing -->

## Allocate separate time for each part of the process
You may have experienced a time where your teacher said you needed to spend a
certain amount of time working on something, and you spent that time but still
didn't feel confident on the topic. 

Total time spent learning is not as important as spending the adequate amount
of time on each part of the process. There is no formula for how much time this
should be. Each individual experiences the learning process differently. 



## Footnotes
[^1]: These instructions are not exact. There is no particular reason to start with a right hand paradiddle in either of these exercises, start with the hand that feels most comfortable to you. I wrote this starting with right hand paradiddles because it's statistically most likely to be the dominant hand of any given reader. 

[^2]: It's fine if you have trouble visualizing this. Diddles are a critical but difficult skill that's best taught in person, not in text.
