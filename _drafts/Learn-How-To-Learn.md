This post is intended for all audiences. 

If you're someone that learns a lot of things, at some point you may have 
wondered how to learn faster and better. (We'll talk about what "better" means
in a bit.) These are my collected thoughts from introspecting on my own learning
process over my 20 years of life so far. 

## What is learning? 
Learning can be described as a 4 step process:
1. Ingest information
2. Understand and contextualize
3. Build mechanical skill when applicable
4. Retain information, context, and skills

As an example, you'll learn about a rudimentary piece of percussion instrument 
technique known as a paradiddle. 

### Ingest Information
Ingesting information is effectively reading a fact. Our example here: 
> A **paradiddle** is a sequence of four notes with a sticking pattern RLRR or LRLL. 

This is quite possibly the first time this information has reached your brain, 
which is expected. It will be mostly devoid of context. You might know what
percussion is, but you probably don't know what sticking is, or what a pattern 
like "RLRR" means. 

While ingesting information, take note of unfamiliar terms. It will help with
revisiting them in the next step. 

### Understand and Contextualize 
To transform words into understanding, we must unpack the definitions involved 
and learn the context in which these concepts exist. 

In the above definition for **paradiddle**, we mention **sticking patterns** and
give some examples. A sticking pattern is a string that denotes which hand you 
should be using to play a note. They're typically used for percussion instruments
that are played with sticks, like drums. Sticking patterns are denoted with 
strings of "L"s and "R"s to indicate playing a note with your left or right hand
respectively. A pattern of "RLRR" indicates that the first note should be played
with your right hand, the second note with your left, and the third and fourth
with your right. 

Sticking notation is only necessary for percussion, as other instruments either 
engage both hands in playing a note, or denote it in other ways. Valved 
instruments engage both hands, while keyboard instruments use separate staffs
(sets of note lines) for each hand. While in many cases sticking doesn't
matter (and is usually not written in those cases), sometimes composers assign
a recommended sticking or note the sticking that they found most comfortable for
complex sequences. 




### Build Mechanical Skill (when applicable)

### Retain information, context, and skills. 

## Set Realistic Goals

## Be Intentional 

## Time matters less
