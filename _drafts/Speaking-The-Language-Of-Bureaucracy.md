## Introduction
Bureaucracy. Death by paperwork in order to accomplish a seemingly simple task. 
Everyone has to deal with it at some point, and it's always a hassle. Sometimes
it seems like it's there just to slow you down. 
Here are my best tips for leveraging the system to get the outcome you want. 

## The Currency of Bureaucracy
While bureaucracy often deals in literal currency, that can be difficult for the
average person to leverage.[^1] More often, bureaucracy deals in public 
reputation. 

## Be Polite 
Everyone in bureaucracy is a human.

## Be Efficient 
When you talk to each person, clearly state your goal, what you've done to
further it so far, and who else you've talked to. 

## Have a plan to convince everyone you meet
Each time you talk to a new person, discern what their responsibilities are, 
how you can help them, and how they can help you. 

## Footnotes
[^1]: Individuals usually can't directly control funding, but often can exercise
indirect control. Many programs, both public and private, receive government 
funding that is conditional on their compliance with federal regulations. 
Individual reports can show the government that programs are not in compliance, 
making the government direct them to comply or risk losing their funding.
