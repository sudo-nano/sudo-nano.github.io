## What is good software?


## Notable Examples
- MultiMC / PolyMC / Prism
- Linus Torvalds 
- Bjarne Stroustrup meltdown over C++ memory safety issues
- Evilsocket
- Vesktop (specifically them closing issues)
- Matrix (refusing reasonable user feedback)

## What do good maintainers do?
Good maintainers **respectfully interface with the community.** 
Make no mistake, maintaining an open source project is an immense amount of work.
Dealing with the massive influx in noobs from your project becoming popular is even
more taxing. However, that is *never* an excuse to stop being compassionate. 
Lots of people will obviously have no clue what they're doing, but that 
doesn't mean you can start treating people like they're stupid, or berating
people that are clearly taking their first baby steps into the project you've
been working on for years.

Good maintainers also consider reasonable feedback from users. 
The ways that developers handle feature requests, feedback on usability, and
feedback on documentation are extremely useful indicators of their mindset.
