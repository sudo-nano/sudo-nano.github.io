## Introduction 
<!-- Insert target audience statement -->

My partner and I have been considering purchasing an espresso machine for some
time. We both love coffee, and find its production fascinating.
<!-- Insert link to Vietnamese Coffee post here -->
The main thing stopping us was the cost. We're college students with an
appreciation for quality, which is a perilous place for our wallets. Espresso
is a prominent part of the coffee world, despite being one of the least
accessible parts of it. When we
saw an espresso machine available at a price-negotiable thrift store, we both
knew we had to have it. Since neither he or the store knew whether it worked, 
he secured it for only $2. 

## Hardware
The espresso machine is a DeLonghi ECP3120. It's a single boiler machine that 
comes with three baskets: a single shot basket, double shot basket, and single 
shot pod basket for use with Easy Serve Espresso pods. All three are 
pressurized baskets. The machine has internal
storage for the extra baskets, which the previous owner clearly did not use. 
The only basket that came with our used machine was the pod basket, which was 
slotted into the portafilter. Against better judgement, I attempted to pull
some single shots with this basket, but all of them turned out undrinkably
acidic. 

Having failed to make use of the stock portafilter and basket, I set out to
find an aftermarket one. This machine uses a 51mm portafilter, which is 
nonstandard. Nobody except DeLonghi uses this size. Most other machines use 54mm.

As I noticed similarity between many of the search results, a sneaking 
suspicion crept up on me. A quick search revealed that indeed, nearly all of
them are 
[resold from Aliexpress.](https://www.aliexpress.us/w/wholesale-51mm-portafilter-2-ear.html?g=y&SearchText=51mm+portafilter+2+ear) 
To their credit, [Normcore's 51mm portafilter and basket](https://www.normcorewares.com/products/normcore-naked-bottomless-portafilter) 
was the only one made in-house. Unfortunately, I only
realized while writing up this blog post, by which point I had already cut out
the middleman and purchased a portafilter directly from Aliexpress. While I 
truly appreciate Normcore's ray of hope amidst the slave labor mass production
garbage, there are still no precision baskets for 51mm portafilters. The only 
3rd party baskets available are the stock ones that come with these portafilters.

## Making Espresso
In the production of our espresso, we used a Baratza Encore 485 grinder, a
star anise bottle as an improvised tamper, and an Aliexpress bottomless 
portafilter with its included double shot basket.
