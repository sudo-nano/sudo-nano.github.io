## Introduction 
<!-- Insert target audience statement -->

My partner and I have been considering purchasing an espresso machine for some
time. The main thing stopping us was the cost. We're college students with an
appreciation for quality, which is a perilous place for our wallets. When we
saw an espresso machine available at a price-negotiable thrift store, we both
knew we had to have it.
