## Introduction
Unlike my usual posting that's full of links and citations, this one is going to
be pretty subjective. What is does it mean to be cool? A poser? How do common perceptions
of these concepts differ from reality, and how does their perception change across
various social groups?
This is the culmination of me stewing on various topics, 
ranging from club organization to fashion, over the past four years. Many of these
concepts seem to come naturally to some. The exact degree to which they are *actually*
natural or learned is something I have yet to find out. No matter how prevalent it is,
it didn't come naturally to me. Keep in mind that my perspective is colored by being
young, queer, neurodivergent, and in a lot of tech spaces.

## What does it mean to be cool?
What *does* it mean to be cool? Coolness is subjective, but one of the most common
traits that people consider to be cool is being put together. Knowing what you want,
having your stuff figured out. This is related to, but not necessarily required by,
the appearance of grace. The perception of grace is, in large part, the absence of
perceived effort.

## Sincerity
Though coolness is contingent upon ignoring the opinions of those who don't matter
(colloquially known as haters), if you don't care about *anyone,* it wraps back around
to being uncool.
