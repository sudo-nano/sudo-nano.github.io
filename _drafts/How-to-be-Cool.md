Other stuff to talk about 
- Absence of good white male role models 
  - Most role models are either physically protectors or financial providers 
  - Role of men as providers has been undermined in part by gender equality (which is fine) and in part by weakening of labor and unions (bad)
  - Construction of masculinity as in opposition to femininity 
- FD Signifier videos to reference 
  - I finally understand edgelords 
  - The masculine urge to join a fascist death squad

## Introduction
Unlike my usual posting that's full of links and citations, this one is going to
be pretty subjective. What is does it mean to be cool? A poser? How do common perceptions
of these concepts differ from reality, and how does their perception change across
various social groups?
This is the culmination of me stewing on various topics, 
ranging from club organization to fashion, over the past four years. Many of these
concepts seem to come naturally to some. The exact degree to which they are *actually*
natural or learned is something I have yet to find out. No matter how prevalent it is,
it didn't come naturally to me. Keep in mind that my perspective is colored by being
young, queer, neurodivergent, mixed Asian and white, and in a lot of tech spaces.

## Confidence
Coolness is subjective, but one of the most common traits that people consider to be cool is being confident and self-assured. Knowing what you want, who you want to be. 
Here we happen upon an interesting distinction: projecting confidence is relatively 
easy, but to truly *be* confident, you must make yourself in the image that you desire.
Without acting upon your self-determination, confidence becomes a facade rather than a
characteristic. 

Confidence is both being firm in your beliefs and principles, and ignoring unfounded
attacks on your beliefs, principles, and character. It's important that only the
unfounded ones are ignored, for ignoring relevant and founded criticisms brings your
sincerity into question.

If you don't care about *anyone,* it wraps back around
to being uncool.

Tangent: Opinions that don't matter vs opinions of those who don't matter 
- Some people feel the need to designate people as those who don't matter rather than simply ignoring their opinions. 


## Grace: A controversial subject
Appearing graceful is, in large part, the absence of perceived effort. Whether or not 
grace is admirable, or desirable for your personal image, is quite subjective.
