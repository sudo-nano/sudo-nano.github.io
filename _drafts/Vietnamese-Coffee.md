## Introduction 
Vietnamese coffee is uniquely strong and flavorful, usually moderated with a 
hefty dose of condensed milk. It's a staple of any Vietnamese restaurant, and 
for good reason. It's good iced or hot, and has more caffeine than a typical 
espresso. 

## Use a Phin
The device used to make Vietnamese coffee is called a *phin*. (Pronounced "feen"). 
It's a four piece metal filter that effectively acts as a drip coffee maker. 
Because it has a metal filter with holes instead of the traditional paper filter,
it allows more of the coffee oils to pass through, contributing to the unique
flavor. 

Finding one at your local Asian market is best. If you can't find one in person, 
you can purchase one [online from Nguyen Coffee Supply.](https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/products/vietnamese-phin-filter-coffee-press?variant=29653223833667)

## Use Robusta Beans
Using a phin is only part of the equation. Most coffee is made with arabica 
beans, but Vietnamese coffee requires robusta beans. Robusta beans have a 
stronger flavor, more bitterness, and more caffeine. The stronger flavor means
robusta is more capable of taking milk without losing complexity of flavor. If 
you own a coffee grinder, buying whole beans and grinding them is always better.
If not, there are plenty of good pre-ground options available. 

As with all things, your first choice should be finding it from a local business.
Supporting local businessess helps your community, and local places will have
coffee that's been roasted more recently. Readers who live in western countries 
may not be able to find whole bean robusta at a supermarket. It hasn't seen 
worldwide popularity the same way arabica has.[^1] For whole bean robusta, you
may have to check local coffee roasters. Most will not have it, you may have to
look specifically for Vietnamese coffee roasters. If no local places carry it, 
you can buy robusta online (whole or ground), also [from Nguyen Coffee Supply](https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/products/hanoi-dark-roast?variant=42595658662146). 

Pre-ground robusta is usually available at brick and mortar H-mart stores or
other Asian markets under the Cafe Du Monde brand.

## Preparation
At this point, you should have your phin and your robusta coffee. 


## Footnotes
[^1]: The specialty coffee world has historically slandered robusta, calling its
taste "rubbery" or "burnt". It is the opinion of this blog that anyone slandering
robusta in this manner has entirely missed the nuance that robusta requires 
different preparation than arabica.
