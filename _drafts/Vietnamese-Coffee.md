## Introduction 
Vietnamese coffee is uniquely strong and flavorful, usually moderated with a 
hefty dose of condensed milk. It's a staple of any Vietnamese restaurant, and 
for good reason. It's good iced or hot, and has more caffeine than a typical 
espresso. 

## Use a Phin
The device used to make Vietnamese coffee is called a *phin*. (Pronounced "feen"). 
It's a four piece metal filter that effectively acts as a drip coffee maker. 
Because it has a metal filter with holes instead of the traditional paper filter,
it allows more of the coffee oils to pass through, contributing to the unique
flavor. 

Finding one at your local Asian market is best. If you can't find one in person, 
you can purchase one [online from Nguyen Coffee Supply.](https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/products/vietnamese-phin-filter-coffee-press?variant=29653223833667)

## Use Robusta Beans
Using a phin is only part of the equation. Most coffee is made with arabica 
beans, but Vietnamese coffee requires robusta beans. Robusta beans have a 
stronger flavor, more bitterness, and more caffeine. The stronger flavor means
robusta is more capable of taking milk without losing complexity of flavor. If 
you own a coffee grinder, buying whole beans and grinding them is always better.
If not, there are plenty of good pre-ground options available. 

As with all things, your first choice should be finding it from a local business.
Supporting local businessess helps your community, and local places will have
coffee that's been roasted more recently. Readers who live in western countries 
may not be able to find whole bean robusta at a supermarket. It hasn't seen 
worldwide popularity the same way arabica has.[^1] For whole bean robusta, you
may have to check local coffee roasters. Most will not have it, you may have to
look specifically for Vietnamese coffee roasters. If no local places carry it, 
you can buy robusta online (whole or ground), also [from Nguyen Coffee Supply](https://nguyencoffeesupply.com/products/hanoi-dark-roast?variant=42595658662146). 

Pre-ground robusta is usually available at brick and mortar H-mart stores or
other Asian markets under the Cafe Du Monde brand.

## Preparation
At this point, you should have your phin and your robusta coffee. Using a gram
scale is highly recommended, but not strictly necessary. Vietnamese coffee is 
typically prepared with 30g coffee per 150-200 mL water.[^2] That's a much stronger
dose than typical drip coffee. Preparation steps are as follows: 

1. Heat water for your coffee to 96C/205F. If you don't have a thermometer or 
temperature controlled kettle, boiling (100C/212F) water is 
also acceptable. You can use as much or as little water as you desire, but the
recommended amount is 150-200 mL. 

2. Measure out 30g of your coffee. If using whole beans, measure 30g of beans
and grind to approximately 46% of the size scale on your grinder. This will 
require dialing in on your grinder for optimal results, as grinders vary in 
their scales. 

3. Put the bottom plate and the cup of your phin on top of your cup. Add your 
ground coffee to the phin, but don't put the filter plate or lid on yet. 

4. Bloom your coffee by slowly pouring a small amount of hot water over the 
grounds. Distribute the water as evenly as you can. Let the grounds sit for 
30 seconds, they should expand slightly. (If they don't, you may need to add 
more water.)

5. Place your filter piece on the grounds and lightly compress them. 

6. Pour water into the phin, filling it to the top. Allow it to empty before
filling with more water. This may take up to a minute. Refill and allow to drip
repeatedly until you have the desired volume of coffee. 

7. Add condensed milk until your coffee is a caramel color. The exact amount is
not important, but 2 teaspoons is a good starting point. 



## Footnotes
[^1]: The specialty coffee world has historically slandered robusta, calling its
taste "rubbery" or "burnt". It is the opinion of this blog that anyone slandering
robusta in this manner has entirely missed the nuance that robusta requires 
different preparation than arabica.

[^2]: This number was generated via empirical testing. No dose smaller than this
was able to fully recreate Vietnamese coffee as tasted by the author, and this
dose was later confirmed to be what their local Vietnamese cafe uses.
