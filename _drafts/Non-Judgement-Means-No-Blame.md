Plenty of progressive spaces describe themselves as "judgement-free" in a variety of
contexts. Most often, this means that someone relaying a story of a difficult
circumstance will not be assigned blame for any adverse outcomes described.
What goes unsaid is whether blame will be assigned to someone else. Some
people jump at the opportunity to ascribe blame to another person in the
relayed story, or even an abstract and unknown other person, 
in order to avoid blaming the storyteller. While this can be a useful 
intermediate for people newly introduced to the idea of a judgement-free space,
the true endpoint is that *blame need not be assigned at all.*

No judgement, of the storyteller *or anyone else involved*, is necessary to
accept that something bad happened to someone. I find this incredibly important
to internalize, both for group settings and in considering your own 
circumstances.
