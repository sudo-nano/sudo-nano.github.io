## Introduction
An implicit assumption in the self-help productivity sphere is that
anyone can succeed if they just pick the right method and commit to it. 
This is not true, because some people need adaptable methods. 
Static methods just don't cut it for many people.

If no method works all the time, how do you tell when and why a method works? 
That's is the hard part. 
It's highly personal, so I can't tell you what goes where. I can only outline the
process by which you can find those answers yourself.

## The Process

## Change your environment before changing your behavior
Pretty much every piece of self-help media emphasizes the importance of building
good habits. Good habits *are* important, but anyone could have told you that. 
Lots of them lampshade the fact that building habits is hard, but don't actually
mention any effective methods. 
The #1 issue with building habits is that changing your behavior by force of
will is extremely difficult. Your behavior is based on your brain and your 
environment, and changing your brain is hard. It's much easier to start out by
changing your environment, because the change in behavior will naturally follow.

For example, I sometimes have a hard time falling asleep, especially when there
are lots of thoughts bouncing around my head. I don't want to forget them in
the morning, but I don't trust myself to remember them. They just keep
bouncing around until I fall asleep, exhausted, at a later time. Years of 
thinking "I just need to remember thoughts better in the morning" having not
worked a single time ever led me to put a whiteboard by my bed. Now, I empty
my thoughts onto the whiteboard and fall asleep much faster. 

## Paper or Digital Notes?
There are a plethora of perspectives on note taking, both in general and for
neurodivergent people.
on note taking. Use this note taking program, use this bullet journal format, 
only use paper notes to avoid digital distractions, et cetera.
My opinion is this: You can, and in fact should, use multiple note taking
methods, if it meets your needs better than sticking to one system. 

Outline for more of this section
- Digital notes are more powerful but require greater effort to not be distracted
- Paper notes are less powerful but less distracting, and sometimes the tactility is really nice. 

## Bootstrapping 
Outline: 
- When you try to start a task and all the shit goes wrong (like someone else leaving a mess in your kitchen), you may have to "bootstrap" your task rather than doing it in the order you prefer 
- Example: Having to eat toast in order to have the energy to clean the pans for bacon
