## Introduction
An implicit assumption in the self-help productivity sphere is that
anyone can succeed if they just pick the right method and commit to it. 
This is not true, because some people need adaptable methods. 
Static methods just don't cut it for some people, including me.

If no method works all the time, how do you tell when and why a method works? 
That's is the hard part. 
It's highly personal, so I can't tell you what goes where. I can only outline the
process by which you might discover those answers for yourself. 

## The Process

## Paper or Digital Notes?
There are a plethora of perspectives on note taking, both in general and for
neurodivergent people.
on note taking. Use this note taking program, use this bullet journal format, 
only use paper notes to avoid digital distractions, et cetera.
My opinion is this: You can, and in fact should, use multiple note taking
methods, if it meets your needs better than sticking to one system. 

Outline for more of this section
- Digital notes are more powerful but require greater effort to not be distracted
- Paper notes are less powerful but less distracting, and sometimes the tactility is really nice.
