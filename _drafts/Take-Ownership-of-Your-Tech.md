## asdf 
Outline:
- Discuss the ways in which you may not really own your technology
	- Cloud service mandatory products
	- Handing your info to the police without a warrant (Specifically mention Ring)
	- Mention Eufy as an alternative to Ring
- Create different grades of tech involvedness
- Taking ownership of your tech requires the average person to learn more about technology, but this is not new. The average person's required learning burden has been increasing as long as we've had technology. 
	- However, "everyone will not just". Changing human behavior is extremely difficult, and directly changing it should be a last resort. 
	- Rather than changing behavior directly, we need to change the environment and let the environment change the behavior. 
	- We must make education easier

## Won't this require people to learn things? 
Yes. There's really no way around it. The amount of things the average person
needs to know is going up. It *has been* going up since the first caveman learned
the difference between poisonous and edible plants. People that didn't keep up
died, whether it was by eating a poisonous plant, being conquered by someone
with better technology, or by being taken advantage of by someone that understands
the tech better than they do. That's why it's pretty universally agreed upon 
that free and mandatory public school is a good thing.[^1]
