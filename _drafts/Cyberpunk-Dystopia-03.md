## Introduction
Intellectual property is a complicated and dense topic, so there will be a lot of covering the basics in this article. 

## Basics of Intellectual Property
### What is intellectual property? 

### Copyright, Patent, and Trademark

### Trade Secrets
Outline: 
- Products that rely on online services must be required to guarantee a minimum time they will maintain their servers 
- Not using an IP for too long (a few years) should require you to relinquish it 
- Government funded IPs should be partially owned by the government. No free bailouts or research money. (Medical research, corporate bailouts)
- Briefly cover "fiduciary duty"
	- For-profit companies are legally obligated to maximize profits for their shareholders.
	- Fiduciary duty is a good thing in some cases, such as your financial advisor having a fiduciary duty to you. 
	- Companies can and will take any measures that aren't illegal to maximize profits. 
	- If you think there's something they categorically shouldn't do for profits, it has to be illegal or they'll do it.
