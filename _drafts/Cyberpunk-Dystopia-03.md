This post is targeted towards a general audience. No prior knowledge is required. 

Intellectual property is a complicated and dense topic, so there will be a lot of covering the basics in this article. 

Outline: 
- Products that rely on online services must be required to guarantee a minimum time they will maintain their servers 
- Not using an IP for too long (a few years) should require you to relinquish it 
- Government funded IPs should be partially owned by the government. No free bailouts or research money. (Medical research, corporate bailouts)
