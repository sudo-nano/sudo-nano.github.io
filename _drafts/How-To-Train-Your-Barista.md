## Someone just sent this to you
If someone handed this to you, you probably work in a cafe that makes bad tea, 
and that’s ok. **Someone handed this to you because they care enough that they 
want the cafe to do better.**

It’s not a reflection on you personally, unless you own the cafe. Assuming 
that’s not the case, whoever’s in charge didn’t think it worth teaching 
employees anything about making tea. I’m here to tell you that it’s worth your 
time. That’s because most coffee shops make shitty tea that’s not worth 
drinking, and you can poach all their tea-loving customers just by making 
passable tea.

## Basic Tea Preparation
### Use more tea, not more time 
If you want more flavor, you use more tea per volume of water, not more time. 
More time, past 4 minutes, only extracts more bitterness from the tea. For 
strong tea lattes or tea that will have milk and sugar, the optimal amount is 
about 1.5 tablespoons (or 2 teabags) for black tea. If you're making a green tea
latte, the optimal amount is about 3 tablespoons of loose leaf tea, or 2 teabags. 

### Use quality tea 
It’s best if you use quality loose leaf, or at the very least quality teabags. 
There are plenty of decent teabags out there, like Mighty Leaf or Yama Moto Yama.
Bigelow and Lipton are bottom of the barrel. 

### Ingredient order
Order of ingredients when steeping is important. Steep the tea in the hot water 
first, so that no milk or sugar blocks the extraction of the tea flavors. Sugar 
next, because otherwise the milk solutes and lower temperature will make it take 
longer to dissolve. Milk last, so that it doesn’t affect the other steps of the 
tea making process.

## Things you should never do with tea 
### Steep the tea directly in milk 
With the sole exception of making chai from scratch, steeping tea directly in 
milk will make it sad and flavorless. I’m looking at you, every single coffee 
shop that makes a ”london fog” by dropping a Bigelow earl gray teabag into a cup 
of steamed milk. The milk has too much dissolved in it for the nice tea flavors 
to get in. Additionally, the ideal milk steaming temperature (55-65C) is much 
lower than the ideal tea steeping temperature[^1], so the extraction 
will be very weak.

### Add 50% or more milk 
Tea is not coffee. Tea is more delicate than coffee. Less milk is required to make 
a balanced drink, tea only needs 10-20% milk.[^Citation Needed] If you add too 
much, you’ll get tinted milk instead of tea. You can even make things easier for 
yourself by using oat milk instead of dairy for your tea. 
It's more delicate, and makes it harder to obliterate the tea with too much milk. 

### Steep non-black tea in boiling water
Non-black teas (green, oolong, white) will burn if steeped in water that’s too 
hot, which will make them overly bitter. Their ideal temperature is about 68C. 
Since this is the guide for people who don’t give a shit, you don’t have to 
bother with a thermometer. If your water is fresh off the boil, throw 2 ice 
cubes in it (based on standard commercial ice maker cube size) or just leave it 
out for a minute.

### Steep tea for more than 5 minutes 
With the exception of herbal teas, don’t. Literally just do not. Tea (as in 
actual tea leaves from the Camellia Sinensis plant) should be steeped for 
a maximum of 4 minutes. Oversteeping will make it 
extremely bitter. No, putting the teabag in the water and then immediately 
pouring the steamed milk in and serving it does not count. As previously 
mentioned, the steeping is effectively stopped as soon as you add the milk.



## Footnotes
[^1]: 87.8C/190F is the ideal steeping temperature for black tea, 76.6C/170F is the ideal temperature for green tea.
