## Why? 
Just this week, I replaced my desktop computer's diseased frankenstein installation 
of Linux Mint 21.1 with EndeavourOS. Having used only Debian-based Linux distributions 
for all of my 7 years using Linux in some capacity, I have become familiar with 
their benefits and their shortcomings. The deal-breaker for me is the inflexibility 
of stable release distributions and the Debian philosophy.
