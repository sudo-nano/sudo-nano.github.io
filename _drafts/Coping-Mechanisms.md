Recently I've become a big fan of the YouTube channel [No Boilerplate](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4)
run by Tris Oaten.
This is likely because we have similar flavors of Spicy Brain (neurodivergence) and
thus process information similarly. His video [Hack Your Brain With Elaborate Coping Mechanisms](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4)
has been a great help to me, and helped me understand why some of my existing coping 
mechanisms work as well as they do. This post will be a review of what tools I use 
for each of his suggested methods, as well as some of my own hard-learned lessons 
about exactly how far I can and can't trust my brain.

## My Implementation of Tris's Methods 
I don't have commentary on every one of the sections in the video, so some have been 
omitted or merged with other sections.

### Declare bankruptcy on your memory / Use a note taking system

Quoth Tris: 
> Your brain is for *having ideas*, not storing ideas. 

I have ADHD. ADHD and many other varieties of neurodivergence make your memory 
unreliable. There is no amount of trying harder that will make your memory reliable. 
Instead, employ paper or digital methods that you like to remember things for you.
It's critical that they be methods that you like, otherwise you won't actually use them. 
Put them in places that are convenient to access whenever you need them. 

I'm
a big fan of [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq). It's an open source program 
that uses Markdown (or Org-mode, if you prefer) to thoroughly manage and organize notes
divided into blocks (basically bullet points). Most importantly, it supports linking 
between pages of your notes, and lets you tag blocks so that it's easier to find them 
later. Obsidian is a popular and more mature alternative, though it's closed source.

### Carry a notebook
For paper notebooks, dot grid notebooks are fantastic. They provide the ruled function
of lined notebooks, while being more visually flexible for playing around with page 
arrangement. If you use pencils, ballpoint pens, or rollerball pens, any paper should 
be fine. I use 
a fountain pen for the interesting inks, so Rhodia is my paper brand 
of choice. Their paper is reasonably priced and doesn't bleed or feather noticeably, 
and that's all I need.

Cortex makes [a nice notebook that costs too much](https://cottonbureau.com/p/TZ4WZJ/journal/the-theme-system-journal#/6880807/grey-paper-standard-journal).
Their style of drawing itemized lists, where the bullet point is a large circle with
a slash through it, is extremely helpful for visualizing task completion. Its key
innovation is the ability to shade half the circle to mark partial completion. 
Typical checkbox lists have no way of representing partial completion, so a list 
where every task is half done is visually indistinguishable from a list where no
tasks have been started. The ability to visualize partial progress is extremely 
important for maintaining morale, so I draw it into my own notebooks by hand.

### Calendars are great 
> If it can be done before the due date, it's a task.

For me, use of a calendar is the #1 corollary to "declare bankruptcy on your memory."
I struggle a lot with remembering when events happen. Determining whether I have an
event at an arbitrary time? Forget it. Anything I need to remember at a specific time 
goes on my calendar. 

If you work the kind of job where people need to meet with you all the time, there are
calendar apps that let you create a booking link. This is a page where people can schedule
meetings with you, and the calendar will only let them schedule times you're available. 
When people schedule the meeting, it will be automatically put on your calendar. While 
I currently have no need for this, I use a calendar app called [Motion](https://www.usemotion.com/) 
that provides it.

Motion has some really cool features, such as automatically scheduling tasks into 
your available time between events. However, I hesitate to recommend it for a few reasons: 
1. **It costs too much.** It's $30 per month. If you prepay for a year, you can cut it down to $19 per month. If you call and ask, there's a secret student discount that cuts the price in half, bringing it to a more reasonable $9.5/mo if you pay by the year.
2. **Customer support is garbage.** The "dedicated support" they advertise is an AI chatbot. The chatbot is useless and only regurgitates help pages. Dealing with that piece of junk is mandatory (albeit brief) if you want to message a real person. They also don't have a help phone number, and will not give you one.
3. **The desktop and mobile apps are electron apps.** For those who aren't programmers, Electron.JS is a framework for creating "web apps" that basically package your website into an application format. An electron app runs an instance of chrome with the website, which is much more resource intensive than programming a regular app. Developers choose it because they can just package the existing website instead of having to program new software.


### Carry Earplugs 
Like Tris, I experience sensory overload, and thus carry earplugs on my keychain. 
If you have over-hear headphones, or earbuds with sufficient passive or active
noise cancelling, those work too. Some think it's disrespectful to carry on 
a conversation while wearing earbuds or over-ear headphones. Additionally, 
I don't like the feeling of active
noise cancelling. To solve these problems, I have a pair of discreet dedicated earplugs.

The last reason I carry earplugs is for hearing protection. This is something I 
feel the layperson doesn't receive enough education about. As a percussionist, 
I wasn't told to wear hearing protection until I had been playing for 6 years. 
Now, I have mild hearing damage and tinnitus. If you're a percussionist, go to
loud concerts, or routinely go anywhere loud enough that you must shout to be
heard, you need hearing protection. 

I recommend "high fidelity" earplugs for musicians. They're designed to evenly 
reduce volume across the entire range of audible frequencies. (Uneven reduction
is what makes things sound muddy when you use typical foam earplugs.) A pair of
these costs about $14-20, comes with a case you can put on your keychain, and 
lasts years. [These Etymotic Research earplugs](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/EarPlugProS--etymotic-research-ety-plugs-high-fidelity-earplugs-standard-fit)
cost $14, and are the same as the $18 Vic Firth percussion earplugs I own but 
without the brand tax. 

### In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess
<!-- Discuss methods from Never Split The Difference -->

## Lessons Learned 
### "Should" is fake, do what you can.
If you are disabled, that means you can't do something the statistically average 
human can do. Sometimes you can do it, but maybe not as often, or it costs you 
more. Don't pretend your differences are not what they are. You are worthy of 
respect as a human regardless of them. More importantly, the sooner you stop 
trying to be "normal", the sooner you can figure out what works best for you.
Give yourself some grace, and plan for what you *can* do, not what you "should" do. 

- If you can't remember to do something later, set a reminder. 
- If something takes you more effort, plan your tasks so that you will be able to put in that effort.
- If something takes you more time, plan for the time you need, not the shorter duration you hope it'll take.

For years, I thought the Pomodoro method (work for about 25 minutes, take a 5 minute break, repeat) 
didn't work for me. Everyone said to do work periods of 20, 25, or 30 minutes. My ADHD is pretty bad. 
I can't concentrate that long, so realistically I have to do 15 minutes. 

### Understand why things work or don't work
Figuring out whether a single method for you is putting a single
brick in the house of coping mechanisms. If you pay attention to *why* things 
do or don't work, you can rule out or further investigate entire categories, 
and build that house one *wall* at a time instead.
