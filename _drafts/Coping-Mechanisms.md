Recently I've become a big fan of the YouTube channel [No Boilerplate](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4?si=eTccUGHOm6_E2IZH)
run by Tris Oaten.
This is likely because we have similar flavors of Spicy Brain (neurodivergence) and
thus process information similarly. His video [Hack Your Brain With Elaborate Coping Mechanisms](https://youtu.be/XUZ9VATeF_4)
has been a great help to me, and helped me understand why some of my existing coping 
mechanisms work as well as they do. This post will be a review of what tools I use 
for each of his suggested methods, as well as some of my own hard-learned lessons 
about exactly how far I can and can't trust my brain.

## My Implementation of Tris's Methods 
### Declare bankruptcy on your memory

Quoth Tris: 
> Your brain is for *having ideas*, not storing ideas. 

I have ADHD. ADHD and many other varieties of neurodivergence make your memory 
unreliable. There is no amount of trying harder that will make your memory reliable. 
Instead, employ paper or digital methods that you like to remember things for you.
It's critical that they be methods that you like, otherwise you won't actually use them. 
Put them in places that are convenient to access whenever you need them. 

I personally am
a big fan of [Logseq](https://github.com/logseq/logseq). It's an open source program 
that uses Markdown (or Org-mode, if you prefer) to thoroughly manage and organize notes
divided into blocks (basically bullet points). Most importantly, it supports linking 
between pages of your notes, and lets you tag blocks so that it's easier to find them 
later. 

## Lessons Learned 
### "Should" is fake, know what you can and cannot do.
If you are disabled, that means you can't do something the statistically average 
human can do. Sometimes you can do it, but maybe not as often, or it costs you 
more. Stop 
trying to pretend your differences are not what they are. You are worthy of 
respect as a human regardless of them. More importantly, the sooner you stop 
trying to be "normal", the sooner you can figure out what works best for the
different body or mind you inhabit.

The areas in which this is most important are memory, willpower, and time. 
If something takes you more memory, more willpower, or more time than it "should", 
and you keep trying to use only the "normal" amount of those things to do it, 
it will not work well. Give yourself some grace, and plan for what you *can*
do, not what you "should" do. 

- If you can't remember to do something later, set a reminder. 
- If something takes you more effort, plan your tasks so that you will be able to put in that effort.
- If something takes you more time, plan for the time you need, not the shorter duration you hope it'll take.
