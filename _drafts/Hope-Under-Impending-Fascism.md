<!-- Consider alternate title: "Where do we go from here?" -->

## Where we are, and how we got here
This is, without a doubt, a dark time in American history. 
You didn't need me to tell you that. 

<!-- Consider deleting summary section on what's been happening -->
For the first time ever, a convicted felon has been elected to the white house.
There were few, if any safeguards against this specific scenario, because few 
ever imagined it could possibly come to pass.
Trump and his cronies have gone completely mask-off, attempting to dismantle
and loot the federal government for personal enrichment.
Elon Musk did a nazi salute at inauguration.
They've launched a horrifying multifront attack on civil rights of all Americans, 
including attempting to dismantle the Department of Education, the National
Labor Relations Board, and trans rights to healthcare and gender changes on
official paperwork.

Perhaps the more pertinent question is this: How did we get here?
As far as I can tell, the answer is this: Republicans pretended to have solutions
to the problems of the average American, while Democrats didn't even acknowledge
the problems. In some cases, they were even maneuvered into positions where
they appeared to be part of the problem, and did not directly address those
poor optics. Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security advisor for Barack
Obama, explains it well in his NY Times guest essay.

>  I would never claim to have all the answers about what went wrong, but I do worry that Democrats walked into the trap of defending the very institutions — the “establishment” — that most Americans distrust. As a party interested in competent technocracy, we lost touch with the anger people feel at government. ...
> As a party committed to American leadership of a “rules-based international order,” we defended a national security enterprise that has failed repeatedly in the 21st century, and made ourselves hypocrites through unconditional military support for Israel’s bombardment of civilians in Gaza.
