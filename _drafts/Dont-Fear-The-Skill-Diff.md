## What is a "Skill Diff?"
Outline: 
- "skill diff" = skill difference
- Whenever you're a beginner at something, you'll inevitably meet someone who is much better than you in a way that is hard to understand. 
- It seems like magic or innate ability from the perspective of one who has not yet seen the path to get there
- When learning, it's important to keep in mind that all skill improvements can be studied and mapped
- Different types of skill 
	- Mechanical skill
	- Strategic skill 
	- Experience/Judgement
	- Knowledge
