I'm gonna spend a lot of time talking about everything I like and don't like about this
one specific jacket. This is not sponsored. I bought it with my own money. 

## Introduction

## I like the style

## I don't like the construction
- "Vintage patina dye" is not friction fast when wet
- Seems like it's trying to emulate waxed jackets without actually needing to be as sturdy as one
- Weft is disintegrating after only 5 years
- Cuffs assembled with fusible interfacing :(

## Warranty Process
Talk about doing the warranty process, after you actually do it lol


## Footnotes
