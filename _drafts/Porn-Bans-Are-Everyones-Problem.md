<!-- Outline
- A number of US states have implemented laws that require verification of government ID in order to view porn on the internet
- Porn sites that don't want to be responsible for handling sensitive personal
information are just refusing service to customers in states with those laws

## Practical Problems
<!-- Outline
- Random sites on the internet SHOULD NOT be handling personally identifiable information like this. (I would say "where unnecessary", but idk if that invites too much discussion over whether this counts as necessary.)
- At present, we are way too incompetent at cybersecurity to be casually handling
this sort of information
- Example: Recently (as of 2025-01-08) Chinese hackers accessed ISP infrastructure used for wiretapping civilians, and used it to spy on politicians.

## Political Problems
<!-- Outline
- These laws are a huge red flag for fascism and Christian fundamentalism
- Fascism and Christian fundamentalism rely on picking out people they believe to be "weird" or nonconforming in some way (this is why queer was a slur btw)
- Porn is something they publicly declare to be weird (never mind the fact that lots of them are pedophiles)

Next Steps for the Fascists: 
- These laws allow them to collect a list of names that they can start targeting
- They can declare queer people's existence to be sexual, and therefore use these laws to start censoring queer existence and representation (preventing kids from knowing that queer people exist, going back to "don't say gay")
- If you're young or not tuned in, you might not know that this is where we were politically just a short time ago 

My Philosophical Disagreements:
- The internet is not for kids! 
- The majority of people are adults. You wouldn't think so based on the level of sanitization that exists on the internet. 
- There's the entirely separate problem of people sanitizing the internet "for kids" but actually for advertisers
- (insert joke about me ranting and raving until I am dragged off the stage)
