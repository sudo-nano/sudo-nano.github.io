It's been nearly a decade since the peak of WiFi hacking, but we're still around and
still going at it. I had quite a difficult time figuring out the lay of the land when
I wanted to return to the hobby recently, so I figured it'd be nice to write it up
for other people. 

## Software
### Apple deprecates `airport`
<!-- TODO: Add date for deprecation of airport utility -->
Apple's deprecation of the `airport` utility in favor of their newer CoreWLAN library
took out most MacOS WiFi hacking software. The only ones that have bounced back and
updated to use CoreWLAN are Kismet and Bettercap. Bettercap still has issues with
channel hopping, leaving Kismet the only fully functional WiFi hacking tool for MacOS.

### Kismet

### Bettercap

### hcxtools 

### How is aircrack-ng holding up?

## File Formats 
### Capture Files 
<!-- Cover pcapng -->

### Hash Files

## Encryption Statistics

## New Threats
