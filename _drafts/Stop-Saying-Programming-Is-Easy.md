## Introduction
If you're in any remotely technical field, you've probably heard the refrain
"teach yourself code." If you're in a hurry, you can even sign

banging your head against a wall than any "teach yourself code" people
will tell you. It challenges even lifelong autodidacts. When you have the desire
to learn and the information in front of you, why does it feel like there's an
invisible wall separating you from understanding programming?
