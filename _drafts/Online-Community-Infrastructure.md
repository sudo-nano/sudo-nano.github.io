This is a response to [Product vs Project](https://friendshipcastle.zip/blog/product-vs-project), 
a thoughtful and timely piece by Twilight Sparkle at [Friendship Castle](https://friendshipcastle.zip). 

Outline: 
- 

> Content moderation and server administration are fundamentally separate actions and things benefit from separate people having those responsibilities. The main problem is that a lot of these skills that were essential to early internet communities are locked away and relegated to experts that are paid too much to want to do this shit on their offtime. Can't blame them.
>
> My therapist has told me that I really shouldn't be so conspiratorial-minded but goddamn this entire thing looks like there is some kind of conspiracy to make building communities harder and harder. Many online communities today barely resemble the communities that our parents and grandparents grew up with. Everything is so alienating and small.

This is, in all likelihood, due to an unfortunate coincidence of factors. First,
the experts. First, basically nobody wants to spend their free time doing the
same thing as their job. It just wears on you, since you feel the additional
weight of it being a job hanging over you, even when you do it for your free
time. Some variety is good for your soul. That means only people who *don't*
administrate systems for work will do it for communities as a volunteer. 

Two factors are decreasing the number of volunteer sysadmins: 
1. Finding a well-paying job has been getting harder (in the US, at least), so
more people with sysadmin skills are doing it professionally since it pays well.
2. Technological literacy is declining, in part due to [corporations fighting against general purpose computing](https://boingboing.net/2012/08/23/civilwar.html).
