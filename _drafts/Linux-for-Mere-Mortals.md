If your technological journey has led you to wondering what the deal is with Linux, 
but it all seems like a bit too much to take in, this is for you. 

## What will Linux do for me if I don't want to spend all day tinkering with it? 
Outline: 
- Less overhead (your computer gets faster for free)
- Package managers 
- No bloatware 
- Escape from capitalism 
- Your system is yours (no constant UI changes just to make things shiny)
