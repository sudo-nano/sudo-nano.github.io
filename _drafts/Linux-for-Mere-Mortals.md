If your technological journey has led you to wondering what the deal is with Linux, 
but it all seems like a bit too much to take in, this is for you. 

## Linux has an attitude problem 
I won't hesitate to acknowledge that the Linux community (and to be honest, computer science in general)
has a problem with being elitist and/or ableist. The Linux community at large
especially has an issue with looking down on users of other operating systems. 
It's time we do better. We're all in it together, and we should act like it. 
This guide is constructed with existing attitudes in mind, and as an attempt 
at improving them. EndeavourOS was selected because it's beginner-friendly in both 
design and community. 

## What will Linux do for me?

### Your computer gets faster for free! 
How is this possible? It's because Linux has less overhead than Windows or MacOS. 
Overhead, in this case, means programs that the operating system runs in the 
background. When you start up your PC, before you even open any programs, Windows 
uses 2.3 GB of RAM. Linux, on the other hand, uses (INSERT AMOUNT). The exact 
amount varies based on your customization, but it will always be less. 

### Installing programs is easier


Outline: 
- Less overhead (your computer gets faster for free)
- Package managers 
- No bloatware 
- Escape from capitalism 
- Your system is yours (no constant UI changes just to make things shiny)
